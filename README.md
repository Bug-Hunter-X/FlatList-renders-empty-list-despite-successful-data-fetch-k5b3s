# React Native FlatList rendering empty list bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data. The issue is intermittent and seems related to the timing of data fetching and component rendering.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component is used to display data fetched from an external API.  While the data is fetched correctly (verified via console logs), the FlatList remains empty. This behavior is inconsistent; sometimes it renders the list correctly, and other times it doesn't. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
4. Observe the inconsistent rendering of the FlatList.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the FlatList is only rendered after the data has been completely fetched and processed.  This can be done effectively using the `useEffect` hook and managing loading and error states appropriately.
